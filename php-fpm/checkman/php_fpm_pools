title: Performance indicators of PHP-FPM pools

description:
 This check parses the information provided by the php-fpm pool status page.
 If you have set pm.status_path, then the configured URL {usually /status} shows interesting
 information about the inner state of the fpm pool when accessed via fcgi directly.
 The agent plugin {php_fpm_pools} fetches these information and processes it.

 Please note that the information provided only affect the configured pools within the server.

 By default the check is always OK and outputs performance indicators including graphs.
 However, levels can be configured via ruleset for many of these indicators.

 First you need to set up 'pm.status_path' in pool settings to make it accessible, at least from localhost.
 We recommend to do it like follows.

 Make sure that all pools you want to monitor are configured with the 'pm.status_path' setting.
 Then determine pools listen socket (see 'listen' directive value).

 For example, you want to monitor standard {/run/php/php-fpm.sock} and set up default 'pm.status_path' value '/status'.
 
 Afterwards execute {systemctl restart php-fpm} to apply this change. This makes
 the socket {/run/php/php-fpm.sock} available via fcgi.
 You can test this by requesting this socket via cgi-fcgi CLI tool.
 {SCRIPT_NAME=/status SCRIPT_FILENAME=/status QUERY_STRING= REQUEST_METHOD=GET cgi-fcgi -bind -connect /run/php/php-fpm.sock}.
 This should give you an output of something like {pool: www ...}.

 Once this works, you need to install the agent plugin {php_fpm_pools} into your
 agent's plugins directory (usually {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}).
 The plugin autodetects running php-fpm processes and parses their configs to find their socket and correct pm.status_path.

inventory:
 One service per configured php-fpm pool will be created.

item:
 A dict with socket and optional path. Default value for 'path' key is '/status'.
